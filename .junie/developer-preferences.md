# About
The `developer-preferences.md` file serves as a **persistent knowledge repository** for developer preferences for AI
agents working on the junie-voice project.

## Primary Function
- **Long-term Memory Storage**: Acts as a persistent memory system where AI agents can store important
   developer-specific preferences for agent interaction and code development that would otherwise be lost between
   sessions

## Key Characteristics
- **Agent-Managed**: Primarily maintained by AI agents, though the developer can edit it to correct inaccuracies
- **Markdown Format**: Uses standard markdown for easy readability and formatting
- **Living Document**: Content is subject to change as the developer-agent relationship evolves
- **Not Versioned**: Because this file contains developer preferences, and not team standards, it is never added to
  version control
- **Instructions**: The agent cannot alter the About section of this document


# Developer Preferences

## Architectural Changes

For any major structural change, always prompt me first, fully explaining the change before proceeding.

## Communication Style

Prefer conversational communication style over formal technical language.
